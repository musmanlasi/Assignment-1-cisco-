    "__________\n",
    "An OOPL (object-oriented programming language) is a programming language that is based on the object-oriented programming model constructed around objects in which programmers define the data type of a data structure, and also the types of operations (functions) that can be applied to the data structure.\n",
    "In this way, the data structure becomes an object that includes both data and functions. In addition, programmers can create relationships between one object and another. \n",
    "Examples of object-oriented programming languages are C++, C#, Java, Pythonz etc. "

    "Benifits:\n",
    "_________\n",
    "1. Multi featured: Oop have multiple features\n",
    "Like : Data Abstraction, Inheritance, constructor, Data Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Dynamic Binding etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Simplicity: OOP provides clear modular structure(real world objects) for programs, so the complexity is reduced and the program structure is very clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Modularity: In oop each object forms a separate entity whose internal workings are decoupled from other parts of the system\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Modifiability: It is easy to make minor changes in the data representation or the procedures in an OO program. Changes inside a class do not affect any other part of a program, since the only public interface that the external world has to a class is through the use of methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Extensibility: Adding new features or responding to changing operating environments can be solved by introducing a few new objects and modifying some existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Maintainability: Objects can be maintained separately, making locating and fixing problems easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Reusability: Objects can be reused in different program. So that the cost of development lowers and also enables faster development."
